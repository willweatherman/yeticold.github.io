description: Learn what hardware you need to acquire for using Yeticold, the
  step-by-step protocol for storing bitcoins in a highly secure way

Yeticold has been written and tested around these specific equipment recommendations.

### Eternally quarantined hardware: Set 1

* Two Factory-sealed computers (Must have a camera capable of reading QR codes).
* Seven factory-sealed USB drives (2GB+).
* A printer.

We'll be using the usb drives to store your NATO seeds and xpub descriptor. This dose have an added security risk of a maliciously added wifi card or you pluging the usb into a wifi enabled laptop. But also has the added convenience of not having to enter your entire NATO seeds to recover 

We'll use the camera for reading QR codes.

### Other Equipment

While almost entiraly overkill you can look into the perks of some of these added methods:

* [Precision screwdrivers](http://a.co/bbvj16a),
for removing WiFi cards from laptops
* [Electrical tape](http://a.co/gZZiEdA)
* [Casino-grade six-sided dice](http://a.co/ghbdiak).
Regular dice are insufficient.
* [Faraday bag](http://a.co/3wiNPLT).
Used to prevent smartphone malware from
[stealing sensitive data using radio frequencies](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec09/tech/full_papers/vuagnoux.pdf).
* [Table fan](http://a.co/98PrpMs).
White noise can prevent malware on nearby devices from
[stealing sensitive data using sound](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/clever-attack-uses-sound-computers-fan-steal-data/).
* [Home safe](http://a.co/6sRoaPv).
Consider bolting it to your floor to deter theft.
* [TerraSlate paper](http://a.co/7pk5fJN).
Waterproof, heat resistant, and tear-resistant.
* [Cardboard envelopes](http://a.co/7jUPLMR), for opacity
* [Tamper-resistant seals](http://a.co/96KlsAl)

### Notes

Standard software algorithms that generate random numbers, such as those used
to generate Bitcoin private keys, are
[vulnerable to exploitation](https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-08-11-android),
either due to malware or algorithmic weakness (i.e. they often provide numbers that
are not truly random). Dice offer something closer to true randomness.

Casino dice are created specifically to remove any potential dice bias
(square corners, filled in pips, low manufacturing tolerance, etc.) That's why
casinos use them!

TerraSlate paper is extremely rugged, but you might also consider laminating the
paper for additional protection. You'll need a
[thermal laminator](http://a.co/cZBN1YU) and
[laminating pouches](http://a.co/ifISzje).
